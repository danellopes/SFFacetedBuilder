### Example of the Builder Design Pattern (Faceted)

This example of the faceted builder design pattern was develop using Salesforce Apex language, but I've originally learned about this pattern in C#, so a few things changed, mainly the methods and syntax available.

This technique allows us to segregate the building functionalities of a large object. For example, you have a Person object with multiple fields for Address, Job, Hobbies, FamilyMembers, and to do all of this in one builder would be too much. You can specify a builder that works like a facade, calling on other builders.
